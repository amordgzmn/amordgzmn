### I'm a software developer who's aiming to keep on learning. 🤓 
Currently, I'm into understanding the different ways to create AI chatbots, as it's the focus of my undergraduate thesis!

### Aiming to build more personal passion projects.
Locking in for thesis currently, but I'm aiming to explore different tech stacks in the future. 🤖 

### Striving to be a life-long learner.
Reviewing for CompTIA Security+ in my free time, hoping to pivot to cybersecurity or at the very least knowledgeable about secure development. 🔐
